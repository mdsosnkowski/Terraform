# GIT - BASIC - LAB 
# Based on Cisco DevNet LaB "brief into to GIT"
# On the Right Hand Panel click on "Shell"
# To accomplish this macro workflow:
# Step	Action	Git Commands
# 1	Clone the Remote Repository	git clone <url>
# 2	Create and Checkout a Local Branch	git checkout -b <new branch name>
# 3	Incrementally Commit Changes	git add <new or modified file>
# git commit -m "Commit Message"

# Get the code from compile, copy and paste the line below
# ? What was the output what did it show you that GIT Did ?
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/dne-dna-code

# Show the files in a list format using "ls -ll"
ls -al 

# Change Directory (cd) into the "dne-dna-code" directory: 
cd dne-dna-code

# Type in "git status"
# ? What was the output and why?
git status

# Make a new branch you can use with the -b command 
git checkout -b mycode 

# Confirm that your branch is called "mycode"
git status 

# Keep your branch up-to-date from github 
# If there are no new changes will you get a notificaiton ?
git fetch 

# Show how changes tracked by GIT of the file "change_me.txt"
cd /intro-python/git-basics/

# should show text
cat change_me.txt

# Overwrite the existing text 
echo MY-ADD > change_me.txt 

# ? Did you see the text "MY-ADD" text
cat change_me.txt

# Confirm with Git using Diff and Status for file changes
# ? What was the output from  GIT ?
git status  

# Show what has changed in the file
# ? What is the -- and what is the ++  ?
git diff 

# To undo changes to a file you can put back to last commit 
# lists the directory path for you to use with GIT to use
pwd 

# Example path - Copy this to use for the Reset to original text 
:/home/....-dna-code/intro-python/git-basics

# Resets to original text
git checkout   /home/....-dna-code/intro-python/git-basics 

# ? Do you see the original text and not the new text ?
cat change_me.txt 

# To reset the whole of a working directory, 
# ? what is the response from Git when you do the following command ?
# ? Which branch was "reset"
 git reset --hard
 git status

# Delete the whole downloaded branch, 
# ? Did the branch detele or was there an error ?
git branch --delete --force <branch name> # ie "mycode"

# Delete a branch that is "Checked out"
# Fix - check out another branch like the "Master" - Then delete
# ? What was GIT's response ?
git checkout master 
git branch --delete --force <branch name> # ie "mycode"

# To make commits you need to setup one time the following
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email your@email-address.com

# For committing use the -m option to avoid opening the text editor
$ git add intro-python/git-basics/change_me.txt
$ git commit -m "Git Commit - Done."
